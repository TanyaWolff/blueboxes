# BlueBoxes
===========
## Here is **BlueBoxes**, the BlueSkies volunteer scheduling application. 
+ We have *hats* and *keys* and interesting ideas. 
+ We have green food and blue bins. 
+ We share rides to the bridge, the beer store and **Blue Skies**. 
+ We help our neighbours. 
+ We return carts. 
+ We make musicians feel honoured to fly halfway around the world to sleep in a tent and have cold showers. 
+ We love outhouses, camping, and water.
+ We revere the outhouse volunteers. 
+ We revere the parking volunteers who park cars the **Blue Skies Way** into tight spaces so day visitors only have to walk 2 kilometers instead of 4. 
+ We rise early and do yoga. 
+ We jam late into the night. 
+ We park, we listen, we play, we reuse, we share. 
+ We love Magoo, Tilston and all BlueSkies organizers
+ We love **BlueSkies**
